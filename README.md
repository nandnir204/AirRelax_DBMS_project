# AirRelax_DBMS_project
Air Relax is an airport lounge management system developed using Python, the Tkinter library, and a MySQL database.
The system enables the booking of individual premium lounges or pooling lounges, with features to add, update, view, and delete lounge areas, passengers, and reservations. 
The application is connected to the MySQL database using mysql-connector-python, and it also leverages numpy, pandas, and python-dotenv for data management and environment configuration. 
This project showcases skills in GUI development, database interaction, and data processing.
